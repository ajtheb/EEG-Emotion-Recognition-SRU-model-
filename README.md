# EEG-Emotion-Recognition-SRU-model-
An EEG-based emotion recognition system using Simple Recurrent Units(SRU) in Pytorch library. It identifies three emotions: positive, neutral and negative. It uses SEED dataset which consist of EEG signal of 15 person with 15 trial in each session. It is an implementation of paper 'EEG-based emotion recognition using simple recurrent units network and ensemble learning'.
